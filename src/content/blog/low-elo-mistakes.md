Wild Rift can be tough for players in lower elo. Improving your rank means understanding and avoiding some common mistakes. Here are the 10 most frequent errors low elo players make, and how to correct them.

## 1. Poor Map Awareness

Many players ignore the minimap, leading to poor decisions and unnecessary deaths.\
To improve:\
• Glance at the minimap every few seconds.\
• Use wards to gain vision of important areas.\
• React to enemy movements, especially when they go missing from lanes.

## 2. Overextending Without Vision

Pushing too far into enemy territory without wards can get you killed.\
Stay safe by:\
• Placing wards in the river or enemy jungle.\
• Not overextending unless you know where all enemies are located.

## 3. Not Last-Hitting Minions

Low elo players often fail to last-hit minions properly, resulting in less gold.\
To fix this:\
• Focus on securing the killing blow on minions to maximize gold income.\
• Practice timing your basic attacks to hit minions at the right moment.

## 4. Poor Objective Prioritization

Ignoring key objectives like Dragons, Herald, and Baron can be costly. Instead:\
• Always contest major objectives with your team.\
• Prioritize dragons early and Baron in the late game for strong buffs.

## 5. Bad Teamfight Positioning

Being out of position during teamfights can lead to quick deaths.\
To improve:\
• ADCs and mages should position themselves in the backline, away from danger.\
• Tanks and supports should focus on protecting carries and engaging properly.

## 6. Chasing Kills

Many low elo players chase enemies too deep into enemy territory, leading to deaths.\
To avoid this:\
• Don’t chase kills when it’s risky. Instead, take objectives or reset.\
• Focus on team goals rather than individual glory.

## 7. Not Communicating with the Team

Lack of communication leads to bad coordination. \
You can fix this by:\
• Using ping tools to alert your team to incoming threats or key objectives.\
• Avoiding toxic behavior and focus on constructive communication.

## 8. Building the Wrong Items

Players often build items that don’t suit the situation.\
 Instead:\
• Adapt your build depending on the enemy team’s composition.\
• Build defensive items if you’re dying often, and offensive items when ahead.

## 9. Ignoring Wave Management

Poor wave management can lead to missing farm or getting caught.\ To improve:\

- Learn when to push and when to freeze waves.\
- Manage waves carefully before attempting to take objectives.

## 10. Playing Without a Game Plan

Many players enter games without a clear strategy.\ Fix this by:\

- Establishing a game plan with your team at the start.\
- Focus on your role’s objectives and adjust as the game progresses.
