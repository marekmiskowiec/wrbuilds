7 Secrets to Become a Pro ADC / Dragon Laner in Wild Rift

The Dragon Lane in Wild Rift is home to the Attack Damage Carry (ADC) role, one of the most impactful positions in the game. As an ADC, your job is to deal consistent damage in team fights and push objectives with your team. However, excelling in this role requires much more than just good mechanics. Here are 7 secrets that can help you become a pro ADC and dominate the Dragon Lane in Wild Rift.

1. Master Last-Hitting and Wave Control

The most basic skill every ADC must have is the ability to last-hit minions. Missing out on last-hits means you’ll fall behind in gold, which delays your item spikes. To become proficient:

    •	Focus on timing your auto-attacks with minions’ low health.
    •	Learn how to freeze the lane near your turret to minimize gank threats.
    •	Push the wave when your enemy recalls or is dead to deny them experience and gold.

Pro Tip: Keep an eye on the map and enemy jungler. If you push your lane too aggressively without vision, you become an easy target for ganks.

2. Positioning Is Everything

Positioning is the key difference between a good ADC and a great one. As the primary damage dealer, you should never be in the middle of a fight. Instead:

    •	Stay behind your frontline, and always kite back.
    •	Avoid diving deep into the enemy team unless you’re 100% sure you won’t get punished.
    •	Use your range advantage to poke from a safe distance before engaging in full team fights.

Pro Tip: Always move between auto-attacks to make yourself harder to hit, especially against champions with skill shots or assassins.

3. Map Awareness and Vision Control

A common mistake among new ADC players is focusing too much on farming without paying attention to the minimap. Great ADCs are always aware of the state of the game:

    •	Look for opportunities to rotate mid after pushing your lane.
    •	Pay attention to dragon spawn timers, as securing objectives is crucial.
    •	Help your support ward key areas like the river bush or dragon pit to avoid enemy ambushes.

Pro Tip: Buy a Control Ward in the mid-game to secure vision around objectives and prevent flanks from enemy assassins.

4. Know Your Power Spikes

Every ADC has specific points in the game where they hit major power spikes based on their items and levels. For example:

    •	Champions like Jinx and Kai’Sa become much stronger after building their core items (Infinity Edge, Runaan’s Hurricane, etc.).
    •	Champions like Ezreal spike when they finish Manamune and Trinity Force.

Understanding your power spikes helps you decide when to play aggressively or when to play defensively. Don’t force fights if you’re behind in items compared to the enemy ADC.

Pro Tip: Always track your item progress and recognize the best times to fight based on your current build.

5. Synergize with Your Support

As an ADC, your performance is often dependent on how well you work with your support. Communicating and synergizing with them can help you win the lane early and snowball into the late game:

    •	Engage Supports (e.g., Leona, Alistar): Play aggressively when they land their crowd control abilities to secure kills.
    •	Peel Supports (e.g., Janna, Lulu): Stay safe and poke the enemy while relying on your support to shield and protect you.

Pro Tip: Learn to adapt your playstyle based on your support. If they engage, you need to follow up. If they’re defensive, focus on farming safely and scaling.

6. Manage Your Mana and Abilities

Wasting abilities or overusing your mana can leave you vulnerable to engages and ganks. Understanding when to use your abilities is crucial:

    •	Don’t spam your abilities unless it’s safe to poke or the enemy has no kill potential.
    •	Always save escape abilities like Ezreal’s Arcane Shift or Vayne’s Tumble for when you’re in danger.

Pro Tip: Make sure to manage your mana wisely, especially in extended laning phases. You don’t want to be caught in a fight with no resources.

7. Team Fight Like a Pro

In team fights, you are the primary damage dealer, and your survival is key to winning. Here’s how to maximize your impact:

    •	Focus on hitting the closest target rather than diving for the enemy backline.
    •	Always auto-attack while moving (kite) to avoid enemy engages.
    •	Use your summoner spells wisely. Flash can reposition you during critical moments, while Heal can save both you and your support in dangerous situations.

Pro Tip: Sometimes it’s better to deal consistent damage rather than trying to pull off flashy plays. Play safe, play smart, and your team will clean up the fight.

Final Thoughts

Becoming a pro ADC is all about improving your decision-making, positioning, and communication.
