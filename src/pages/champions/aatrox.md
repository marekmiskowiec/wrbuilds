  "                Aatrox enhances his next attack every few seconds to deal bonus physical damage and heals himself for the same amount of damage done. The cooldown of Aatrox's passive is reduced by a few seconds when Aatrox hits a champion or large monster with an attack or ability.

  You can see when Aatrox passive is available when the yellow bar underneath his health bar is full. Every time this bar is full, you should look to fight the enemy champion, as you will deal a lot of damage and get a lot of healing. The healing is reduced to 50% against minions."
