early_game: "In the early game, Aatrox should focus on farming and controlling his lane. His Q (The Darkin Blade) is a great tool for harassing enemies and forcing them into bad positions. Try to hit enemies with the edge of your Q, as it deals more damage this way. Also, use E (Umbral Dash) to extend the range of your attacks or dodge enemy abilities. Avoid aggressive trading if your opponent has the advantage in the early levels, and take advantage of your passive healing by landing your abilities."
mid_game: "In the mid game, Aatrox becomes stronger, especially after acquiring key items like Sterak’s Gage or Black Cleaver. At this stage, you can start to more actively support your team, especially in team fights. Your R (World Ender) provides massive healing and increased mobility, allowing you to dive deep into fights, dealing damage while soaking up enemy attacks. Try to target the enemy backline, but make sure you have team support so you’re not quickly eliminated."
late_game: "In the late game, Aatrox becomes a powerful frontliner. Your goal is to initiate team fights or engage at the right moment when enemies are out of position. Your Q combined with R allows you to deal significant damage to multiple targets, and E helps with mobility during fights. Remember to make use of the healing and durability provided by your abilities to survive long engagements. At this stage, you need to balance between aggressive attacks and defending key members of your team."
